# Zolygon

**Zolygon** is a next-generation open-source geometry kernel written in **Zig**.  
It unifies **NURBS-based CAD solids** and **mesh-based DCC geometry** under one clean, high-performance architecture.

---

## Vision

> Build a modern, open geometry engine that is as precise as a CAD kernel  
> and as fluid as a DCC modeling core.

Zolygon bridges two worlds:

| CAD Domain | DCC Domain |
|-------------|-------------|
| NURBS, B-Rep solids | Meshes, subdivision surfaces |
| Parametric precision | Artistic flexibility |
| STEP / IGES formats | glTF / USD formats |

The goal: enable **exact and expressive** modeling in the same scene.
